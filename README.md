# CryoStarEngine
CryoStar Engine: Runs cool, shines bright

## Project Purpose
1. To create a Game Engine using modern tools and with a focus on learning.
2. To practice using C++11 features
3. To become more familiar with the C++ Standard Library
4. To develop type-safe and resource-safe code (By following practices set out in the C++ Core Guidelines)
5. To develop knowledge of how to create/implement:
  * Shaders
  * Multithreaded tasks/jobs
  * Futures
  * An Entity/Component model
  * Object pooling
  * Smart pointers
  * Networking
  * Mathematics for transforming objects in 3D space
  * Basic physics interactions
  * A cross-platform compatible runtime
  * A delta-time game loop
  * constexpr math and resource utilitites
  * Efficient but useful strings

## Getting started

### Tools needed
* Visual Studio 2015 (Compatible with [Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx))
* Git (Using the Git integration for Visual Studio 2015 is recommended)

### Steps
1. Clone the project
2. Open the CryoStarEngine.sln solution file in Visual Studio
3. Compile

## Why CryoStar?
The name idea started from my recent curiosity on the topic of Cryonics. "Cryonix" sounded like a winner for the name but there's already a Game Engine by the [same name](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cryonix/)
Searching for cold things led me to [Brown Dwarf Stars](http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/cosmic_reference/brown_dwarfs.html) which are quite fascinating and as such I created a synonym for these literally cool celestial objects and used it as the name for this project.
