# CryoStarEngine
CryoStar Engine: Runs cool, shines bright

## Project Purpose
1. To create a Game Engine using modern tools and with a focus on learning.
2. To practice using c++11 features
3. To develop knowledge of how to create/implement:
  * Shaders
  * Multithreaded workers
  * Networking
  * Mathematics for transforming objects in 3D space
  * Basic physics interactions
  * A cross-platform compatible runtime

## Getting started

### Tools needed
* Visual Studio 2015 (Compatible with [Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx))

1. Clone the project and run the CryoStarEngine project

## Why CryoStar?
The name idea started from my recent curiosity on the topic of Cryonics. "Cryonix" sounded like a winner for the name but there's already a Game Engine by the [same name](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cryonix/)
Searching for cold things led me to [Brown Dwarf Stars](http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/cosmic_reference/brown_dwarfs.html) which are quite fascinating and as such I created a synonym for these literally cool celestial objects and used it as the name for this project.
